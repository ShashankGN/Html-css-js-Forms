cloud computing is pay as u use.
shared responsibility model->buidling security,physical network security,physical computer security are carried on by the Azure
Data,devices,user accounts->client management
Authentication platform.application settings,network and firewall settings are carried on or taken care by both client and Azure together
Mixed->cloud virtual machine responsibility
Mixed/Shared->Cloud app service responsibility
Mixed/Shared->Cloud Saas Responsibility
OnPremises->all client responsibility
Iaas->
Paas->web apps,sequeldatabase
Saas->office365

public cloud->available for general public
this is available to everyone who wants to use or purchase them
private cloud->providing service over the internal network to only selected users
ex:Stack HCI
hybrid cloud->combines both private and public cloud

VM->Region,OS(SKU/License),Instance size,Disktype/size,
Bandwidth,backupstorage,reservation/savings plan,support agreement
factors that affect the cost of VM

Databases->API choice,Regions,Standardmodels/serverless,no. of operations/sec,consumed storage,optional dedicated gateway,backup storage
factors that affect the cost of DB

pay for time,pay for GB(storage),pay for operations(reading and writting to disks,pay per query to a database etc.)




high availability->uptime for service or remain operational to users
Scalability->accomodating according to increase or decrease in demand by adding or removing resources
it makes the changes in the system design accordingly
types of scaling:vertical scaling(it has limit and availability is not guranteed) also called scaling up or scaling down,Horizontal scaling also called scaling in or out(by adding servers,it has no limits,increase availability),
Elasticity->the ability of system to quickly and easliy scale up or down according to requirement,autoscaling
Availability,Reliability,Predcitibility->3 pillars of high quality platform service
Reliability->ability of a system to perform its specified function without interuption and with high accuracy
how good the results or output
Predictibility->to forecasts and control the performance and behaviour and able to predict the future costs
Security->protection from threats and hackers
Governance->process of designing ,implementing and monitoring the cloud operations
Managability->management of cloud and management in cloud
of cloud->templates,automation,scaling,Monitoring and alerts,self healing
in cloud->web portal,CLI and scripts,APIs,powershell


Cloud services->IaaS,PaaS,Saas
IaaS->Computing,Storage,Networking ex:windows server is in cloud,Azure VMs,Azure storage,Virtual Networking
ex:GCE,Azure
PaaS->middleware,development tools,database server plus IaaS
Computing->ex:Azure app services
Storage->ex:Azure SQL database
networking->Azure Front door(load balancing,firewall etc.)
ex:AWS,Google app engine
Saas->cloud apps 
ex:office365,onedrive,googledrive,dropbox,googledocs,skype,
serverless->a pricing model,paying for service and not renting hardware
ex:selecting the DTUs based on requirement in PaaS
ex:depending on usage of service the price is varied(depends on the seconds the CPU is used) but there are no much option
serverless services->functions,Container apps,kubernetrs,SQL database,CosmosDB



regions->areas of world where Azure has datacentres
region pairs->for backups
Soverign regions->shld need permission or subscription,has some predefined compliance standard,Secret and higly important data
Availabiltiy zones->physical separate locations within each Azure region
Availability zones services->Zonal service,Zone redundant service,Always available service
Zonal services->deploying in more than one zone
Zone redundant service->Automatic Deployment across zones
Always available services->always on, global services
Ex:Azure portal,Azure front door
Resources->Azure service that client can access ex:VMs,Storage accounts,Database
Resource groups->grouping of resources
Subscriptions->billing unit
Management groups->contains one or more subscriptions,Azure policy



Technical pillars of Azure->compute services,Networking services,storage services,Database services

Azure computing services->executing code
types->VM,VM scale set,Web apps,Azure Container instances,Azure container apps,Azure virtual desktop
VM->virtual server,a single machine has been subdivided into slices
Standalone server analogy->server which is isolated as single
Virtualization->allowing multiple virtual instances to run on a single physical hardware
increasing size of VM by adding CPUs->scale up,has limit
adding the virtual machines->scale out,has no limit
VM scale set->group of VMs grow and shrink in quantity based on predefined rule
app services(web apps)->running code in the cloud,give the code azure will run it based in the configurations given,PaaS
Container services->containers contain everything the app needs in container image
Container services->Azure Container Instance,Azure Container Apps,Azure Kubernetes service
ACI->single instance
ACA->easy to use as a web service
AKS->runs on a cluster of servers
Azure virtual desktop->desktop version of windows which runs in cloud
Azure functions->small pieces of code that run in cloud,cheapest way to run code in cloud,ex:doing some small tasks at frequent interval
Virtual networking services->VNets,azure network over the globe
subnets->Vnets are subdivided into subnets
VMs connect to subnet through NIC cards
Network security group->has Access control list, allows specified address to connect
Peering->connecting two subnets together present on two different network which allows communication between VM on one network with VM on different network
Azure DNS->Gives private IP address stored inside the DNS of Azure
VPN Gateway->provides connection between two network
VPN->P2S,S2S
ExpressRoute->private connection between ISP and Azure endpoint,private connection between an organizationâ€™s on-premises infrastructure and Microsoft Azure data centers
Public endpoints->who can access
private endpoints->who can access,gives private connection facility
